# United-Kingdom-Gender-Pay-Gap

## Project Overview 
The Minister of State for Employment holds the responsibility for addressing the pay gap in the United Kingdom, with particular focus on the gender pay gap. This gap represents the difference in average gross hourly earnings between women and men.

There are several contributing factors to the gender pay gap. These may include differences in education levels, variations in work experience, and other underlying factors. For instance, a higher proportion of women are employed in certain economic sectors where the average wages tend to be lower compared to other industries.

Furthermore, within the same sector, men are often found in positions that offer higher pay than those typically held by women. As a result, these disparities in sector representation and role distribution contribute to the overall gender pay gap observed across the United Kingdom.

### Problem Statement
UK employers continue to have notable gender pay gaps, varying by industry, region, and company size. Late report submissions suggest reduced organizational accountability. employer data from 2017-2025.

### Approaches
1-	Identify employers with extreme gender pay gaps.

2-	What are the patterns of gender pay disparity across different industries in UK.

3-	What are the patterns of gender pay disparity across different regions in UK.

4-	What are the patterns of gender pay disparity across different employer size in UK.

5-	Does submission timeliness affect the gender pay gap?

6-	Is there a gap between men and women across low, middle, and top pay quartiles?

7-	How has the gender pay gap in the UK shifted over time from 2017 to 2025?

### Conclusion
1- Gender pay disparities vary significantly by employer size, with medium and large-scale employers showing the greatest imbalances.

2- Women are overrepresented in lower-paid quartiles, while men dominate senior roles with 20%+ gaps.

3- Extreme male- and female-favoured gaps reflect structural inequalities within specific sectors.

4- High-income, male-dominated industries show the widest gender gaps, especially financial services and construction.

5- Regional differences indicate that some locations consistently experience higher gender pay disparities.

### Recommendations
1- Enhance women’s access in market to higher-paid and leadership roles through structured progression pathways.

2- Promote transparent and bias-free processes in high-gap industries.

3- Reduce concentration of women in lower quartiles by improving job design, flexibility.

4- Benchmark policies from small and corporate employers that show more balanced outcomes.

5- Strengthen reporting accuracy by adding missing demographic variables and standardizing submissions.

6- Apply region-specific equality initiatives to reduce area-based disparities.
